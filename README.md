# VQ-NeRF

This is the code release for [VQ-NeRF Home Page](https://jtbzhl.github.io/VQ-NeRF.github.io/).


## Acknowledgements

Our codes is mainly built upon the following projects. We sincerely thank their authors firstly:
- [NeRFactor](https://github.com/google/nerfactor)
- [NeuS](https://github.com/Totoro97/NeuS)
- [Sonnet](https://github.com/google-deepmind/sonnet)


## Overview

Clone this repository:

```shell
https://github.com/JiuTongBro/vqnerf_release.git
```

Our method requires a two-stage running. The first stage is for the geometry reconstruction, and the second stage is for the decomposition and segmentation.
- The codes for geometry reconstruction are under the `geo/` folder. It is an edited version of [NeuS](https://github.com/Totoro97/NeuS)
- The codes for decomposition and segmentation are under the `decomp/` folder. It is modified based on [NeRFactor](https://github.com/google/nerfactor). This is the main part of our codes.


## Data

Download the data from [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YjWhKcip-nEvheOjzb1epgNSkJi8K9UL?usp=sharing). Then place all the items under the `data/` folder.

There are five types of datasets:
- `nerf` dataset: It is a CG dataset, containing five NeRF-Blender scenes. The GT images are stored in `data/nfr_blender`, the GT albedos and relighted images are stored in `data/vis_comps`, the GT segmentation labels are stored in `data/nerf_seg1`.
- `mat` dataset: It is a CG dataset collected by us, containing three scenes with GTs for all BRDF attributes. It is stored in `data/mat_blender`.
- `dtu` dataset: It is a real dataset, containing three scenes collected from the NeuS-DTU dataset. It is stored in `data/dtu_split2`.
- `ours` dataset: It is a real dataset collected by us, containing three scenes. It is stored in `data/colmap_split`.
- `hw` dataset: It is a real dataset collected by us, containing four scenes. It is stored in `data/1115_hw_data/1115data_1`.

The coordinate system for `nerf`, `mat` and `hw` dataset follows NeRF-Blender, while the coordinate system for `dtu` and `ours` dataset follows NeuS-DTU.

The `data/test_envs` stores a total of 16 envrionment maps for relighting. Eight of them are released by the [nvdiffrec](https://github.com/NVlabs/nvdiffrec), and the other eight are collected by us. For some types of the datasets, we flipped those illumination, as the 'upper' direction is reversed in those scenes.


## Geometry Reconstruction

Go to the `geo/` folder, prepare and activate the environment.

```shell
cd geo
conda create --prefix="./geo_env" python==3.6
pip install -r NeuS-ours2/requirements.txt
conda activate ./geo_env
```

Go to the code folder and link the data from the project root:

```shell
cd NeuS-ours2
ln -s <project_root>/data ./
```

Then follow the instructions in [geo/NeuS-ours2](https://github.com/JiuTongBro/vqnerf_release/tree/main/geo/NeuS-ours2).
